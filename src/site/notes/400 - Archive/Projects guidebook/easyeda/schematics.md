# EasyEDA Schematics

This section covers schematic diagram creation within EasyEDA, a free Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tool.

## 1. Overview

EasyEDA facilitates schematic design, circuit simulation, and PCB layout. It is available as a web-based application and a desktop client.

## 2. Schematic Creation Workflow

### 2.1. Project Initialization

1.  Open EasyEDA.
2.  Create a new project.

### 2.2. Component Placement

1.  **Locate Components:** Utilize the search bar or browse the "EElib" and "Common Library" for components (e.g., resistors, capacitors, integrated circuits).
2.  **Place:** Drag and drop selected components onto the schematic canvas.
3.  **Rotate:** Select a component and press 'R' or the spacebar to rotate.

### 2.3. Component Interconnection (Wiring)

1.  **Activate Wiring Tool:** Select the wiring tool.
2.  **Draw Connections:** Click on a component pin, drag the wire to another pin, and click to establish connection. Press Escape to terminate the wiring operation.

### 2.4. Attribute Editing

Double-click on a component or its associated value to modify properties such as resistance, capacitance, or part numbers.

### 2.5. Organization and Annotation

*   **Movement:** Drag components to reposition them.
*   **Labeling:** Add labels, net names, and text annotations for clarity.
*   **Hierarchy:** Employ hierarchical design and multi-sheet schematics for complex projects.

## 3. Key Schematic Features

*   **Component Library:** Access to a comprehensive collection of pre-defined components.
*   **Custom Symbol Creation:** Ability to create user-defined symbols for unavailable components.
*   **Design Manager & DRC:** Tools for error checking and design rule verification.
*   **Netlist Generation:** Automatic generation of netlists for PCB layout.
*   **Bill of Materials (BOM):** Generation of a list of all components used in the design.
*   **Simulation:** Circuit simulation capabilities for design verification.
