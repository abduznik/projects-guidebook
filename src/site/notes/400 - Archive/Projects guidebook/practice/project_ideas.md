# Project Ideas

This section provides a list of project ideas to practice your skills in Python and ESP32.

## Python Project Ideas

### Beginner

*   **Number Guessing Game:** A simple console game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number.
*   **Calculator:** A basic calculator with a command-line or graphical interface (using Tkinter).
*   **To-Do List:** A simple application to add, remove, and view tasks.

### Intermediate

*   **Weather App:** A program that fetches weather data from an API and displays it to the user.
*   **Web Scraper:** A script that extracts data from a website (e.g., news headlines, product prices).
*   **Data Visualizer:** A program that reads data from a file (e.g., CSV) and creates plots and charts using a library like Matplotlib or Seaborn.

### Advanced

*   **Face Detection:** A program that detects faces in images or a live video stream using a library like OpenCV.
*   **Chat Application:** A simple client-server chat application using sockets.
*   **Web Application with a Database:** A web application built with a framework like Flask or Django that interacts with a database.

## ESP32 Project Ideas

### Beginner

*   **Blinking an LED:** The "Hello, World!" of microcontrollers.
*   **Reading a Sensor:** Read data from a simple sensor like a DHT11 (temperature and humidity) or a photoresistor (light).
*   **Controlling an LED with a Button:** A simple digital input and output project.

### Intermediate

*   **Weather Station:** A project that reads data from multiple sensors (e.g., temperature, humidity, pressure) and displays it on an LCD or OLED screen.
*   **Bluetooth Controlled Car:** A simple robot car that can be controlled via Bluetooth using a smartphone app.
*   **Wi-Fi Scanner:** A program that scans for nearby Wi-Fi networks and displays their names and signal strengths.

### Advanced

*   **Home Automation System:** A system that allows you to control lights, fans, and other appliances in your home using a web interface or a mobile app.
*   **GPS Tracker:** A project that gets GPS coordinates and sends them to a web server to be displayed on a map.
*   **Camera-based Project:** A project that uses an ESP32-CAM to take pictures or stream video.

## Combined Python & ESP32 Project Ideas

*   **Serial Data Logger:** An ESP32 that reads sensor data and sends it to a Python script running on a computer, which then logs the data to a file.
*   **GUI for ESP32:** A Python GUI (using Tkinter or another library) that communicates with an ESP32 over serial to control its outputs and display its sensor readings.
*   **IoT Dashboard:** An ESP32 that sends sensor data to a web server, and a Python web application that displays the data on a dashboard.
